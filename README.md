## SIEM with ELK Stack

### Introduction

The objective of this project is to implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) on Kali Linux. This system will collect, analyze, and visualize security data from various sources within a network, enabling real-time monitoring and alerting for security events.

**Technologies Used**

* **Elasticsearch**: A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine.
* **Logstash**: A server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to a “stash” like Elasticsearch.
* **Kibana**: An open-source data visualization and exploration tool for reviewing logs and time-stamped data.
