# Alerts

### Step 1: Install and Configure Watcher

1. **Enable the Watcher feature** in Elasticsearch (if not already enabled):
   *   Edit `elasticsearch.yml`:

       ```yaml
       xpack.watcher.enabled: true
       ```
2. **Create a Watcher alert**:
   * Use the Kibana interface or create a JSON configuration for the alert.

### Step 2: Create an Alert in Kibana

1. **Go to the Management tab** in Kibana:
   * Click on `Watcher` (under Elasticsearch).
2. **Create a new watch**:
   * Define the conditions for the alert (e.g., a specific error log entry).
3. **Set up actions**:
   * Configure how you want to be alerted (e.g., email, Slack).
4. **Save and activate the watch**:
   * Monitor the alerts and adjust the conditions/actions as needed.
